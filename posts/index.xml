			<description>For a graph $G = (V, E)$, we say $G$ contains a hole with length $\ell \ge 4$ if there is an induced cycle with length $\ell$. An odd (even) hole is a hole with $\ell$ being odd (even, respectively).
From the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem, a graph that has neither an odd hole nor an odd anti-hole (a hole that is in the complement graph) is perfect. That is, $$ \omega(H) = \chi(H) $$ for all induced subgraph $H$ of $G$.</description>

<p>From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_perfect_graph_theorem">Strong Perfect Graph Theorem</a>, a graph that has neither an odd hole nor an odd anti-hole (a hole that is in the complement graph) is perfect. That is,
$$
\omega(H) = \chi(H)
$$
for all induced subgraph $H$ of $G$. Also, graphs that are odd-hole-free or even-hole-free had some interesting properties <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Sadly, D. Bienstock had proven that <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> the problem of determining if there is an hole in $G$ passing through a given node with specified parity is NP-complete. While polynomial time even hole detecting algorithms is developed in 2002 by Conforti, Cornuéjols, Kapoor and Vušković, <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
the problem of detecting if there is an odd hole in $G$ in polynomial time remains open until recently (2019) Chudnovsky, Scott, Seymour, Sprikl gives a polynomial time algorithm <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> that detects an odd hole.</p>
<p>In this note I will try to organize my understandings (which may be super wrong) of the algorithms (mainly by Chudnovsky, Seymour et al., since I spend most of time studying those) that detect several variants of odd/even holes.</p>
<h2 id="odd-hole-detection-algorithm">Odd hole detection algorithm</h2>
<p>First of all, let peek into the specification of this algorithm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Input: An n-node graph $G$.<br>
Output: Determine if $G$ contains an odd hole.<br>
Time: $O(n^9)$.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Althought the algorithm is designed to answer a yes or no question, but the algorithm can be slightly modified to output the detected odd hole.</p>
<p>The core of the algorithm is based on the following theorem (Theorem 4.1 of <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>With certain types of induced subgraphs forbidden and vertices forbidden</strong>, shortest path between any pair of vertices on a shortest odd hole $C$ is a shortest path on $G$. Also, replacing the path with any other shortest path on $G$ between them will induce another shortest odd hole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the theorem we can see that if the condition is satisfied, a shortest odd hole can be constructed by connecting shortest paths. So the problem becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a general graph $G$, can we find a graph $H$ that contains an odd hole if $G$ contains one, while satisfying the conditions?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the intuitive way is to build the graph $H$ from $G$ by removing the subgraphs.</p>
