      <description>For a graph $G = (V, E)$, we say $G$ contains a hole with length $\ell \ge 4$ if there is an induced cycle with length $\ell$. An odd (even) hole is a hole with $\ell$ being odd (even, respectively).
From the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem, a graph that has neither an odd hole nor an odd anti-hole (a hole that is in the complement graph) is perfect. That is, $$ \omega(H) = \chi(H) $$ for all induced subgraph $H$ of $G$.</description>

      <description>Greetings, I am Hou Teng Cheong, currently an M.S. student in Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Taiwan University. I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from NTU in 2018.
My research interest includes algorithm design, computational complexity and graph theory. Recently my research focus on hole detecting algorithms.
I am going to receive my M.S. degree in this year and looking for a PhD position in Fall 2021.</description>
